#Analyze NYSE Data

In this project, you'll use statistics and spreadsheet programs like Excel to analyze data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. You'll also forecast financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for a company of your choice from the NYSE dataset.

###Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). You will need to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate your findings about it. You will use spreadsheets to make your analysis easier (please do not analyze by hand - it will take forever!).

Prepare with the descriptive statistics and spreadsheets lessons leading up to the project.

###What skills will I use?
After completing the lessons and the project, you should feel comfortable in your ability to:

Identify different datatypes to determine what analyses are possible.
Calculate measures of center and spread to describe quantitative data.
Use a variety of spreadsheet functionality to gain insights from data.
Build charts and graphs to communicate the results of your analysis
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Analyze a future dataset using Excel
